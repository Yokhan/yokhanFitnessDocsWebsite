# Domain Software Review

## How to Use
When reviewing code, architecture, or engineering decisions, check against these evidence-based practices.
Flag any anti-pattern found. Suggest the corresponding best practice. Cite evidence level.

**Evidence Scale:** A = systematic review/large-scale empirical study. B = seminal work/major industry study. C = expert consensus/widely accepted practice.

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER recommend)

### Code Level

1. **Magic Numbers / Hardcoded Values** — Unexplained numeric literals in code (e.g., `if (status == 3)`). WHY: destroys readability, error-prone refactoring. INSTEAD: named constants, enums, config files. EVIDENCE: C

2. **Swallowing Exceptions (Silent Catch)** — Empty catch blocks discarding errors. WHY: ~20% of errors never reach logs; creates "silent failures" extremely difficult to debug. INSTEAD: log with stack trace, catch specific exceptions, rethrow when appropriate. EVIDENCE: B

3. **God Object / God Class** — Single class accumulating all responsibilities. WHY: 0.55 Spearman correlation between anti-pattern count and bug count (ArXiv 2021). INSTEAD: decompose into cohesive classes with single responsibilities. EVIDENCE: B

4. **Stringly-Typed Programming** — Strings where enums/types should be used (`role = "admin"`). WHY: no compile-time checking, typos become runtime bugs, no IDE autocomplete. INSTEAD: enums, union types, typed constants. EVIDENCE: C

5. **Copy-Paste Programming** — Copying code without understanding it (Stack Overflow, AI output). WHY: propagates bugs, introduces undebugable code; "generative cargo cult programming" with AI. INSTEAD: understand before integrating, write tests. EVIDENCE: B

6. **Premature Optimization** — Optimizing before profiling identifies bottlenecks. WHY: wastes time on the 97% that does not matter (Knuth 1974). INSTEAD: profile first, optimize the critical 3%; choose good algorithms upfront. EVIDENCE: B

7. **Deep Nesting (Arrow Code)** — Functions with >3 levels of nested conditionals. WHY: neuroscience research shows exponentially increased cognitive workload (PMC 2023). INSTEAD: early returns, guard clauses, extract functions. EVIDENCE: B

8. **Boolean Blindness** — Bare booleans with unclear meaning (`process(true, false, true)`). WHY: caller cannot understand parameter meaning; high bug risk during maintenance. INSTEAD: named parameters, enums, option objects. EVIDENCE: C

9. **Mutable Global State** — Globally accessible mutable variables shared across modules. WHY: IEEE study (2020) found increased defect proneness; unpredictable, hard to test. INSTEAD: pass dependencies explicitly, use immutable data, limit scope. EVIDENCE: B

10. **Long Parameter Lists** — Functions taking >4-5 parameters. WHY: increases cognitive load, callers frequently confuse parameter order. INSTEAD: parameter objects, builder pattern, decompose function. EVIDENCE: C

11. **Commented-Out Code** — Dead code left in comments "just in case." WHY: creates confusion, accumulates noise; version control preserves history. INSTEAD: delete it; retrieve from git if needed. EVIDENCE: C

12. **Inappropriate Comments (What, Not Why)** — Comments restating what code does. WHY: redundant comments rot faster than code; >30min/day wasted on bad documentation. INSTEAD: self-documenting code for WHAT; reserve comments for WHY. EVIDENCE: C

13. **Ignoring Return Values / Error Codes** — Discarding error-indicating return values. WHY: equivalent to swallowing exceptions; creates silent invalid state. INSTEAD: always check return values; use result types. EVIDENCE: C

14. **Type Coercion Abuse** — Relying on implicit type conversions (JS: `"" == false`). WHY: produces surprising behavior, source of subtle bugs. INSTEAD: strict equality, explicit conversions, TypeScript. EVIDENCE: C

15. **Primitive Obsession** — Primitives representing domain concepts (`string email`). WHY: no validation at type level, invalid states representable. INSTEAD: value objects, domain types. EVIDENCE: C

16. **Null Returns (Billion Dollar Mistake)** — Returning null for normal absence of value. WHY: Tony Hoare called null references his "billion-dollar mistake"; top cause of production errors. INSTEAD: Option/Maybe types, null object pattern. EVIDENCE: C

17. **Callback Hell / Pyramid of Doom** — Deeply nested asynchronous callbacks. WHY: unreadable, unmaintainable, error handling nearly impossible. INSTEAD: async/await, Promises, reactive patterns. EVIDENCE: C

### Design Level

18. **Premature Abstraction** — Abstractions after seeing only 1-2 instances. WHY: Sandi Metz: "duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction." Wrong abstraction costs compound. INSTEAD: Rule of Three; AHA (Avoid Hasty Abstractions). EVIDENCE: C

19. **DRY Obsession (Over-DRYing)** — Eliminating ALL duplication regardless of whether pieces represent same concept. WHY: creates coupling between unrelated features; overly generic abstractions. INSTEAD: DRY applies to knowledge, not syntax; use WET/AHA. EVIDENCE: C

20. **Singleton Overuse** — Singleton as global access point throughout the application. WHY: hidden global state, breaks encapsulation, makes testing extremely difficult. INSTEAD: dependency injection; create instances explicitly. EVIDENCE: C

21. **Inheritance for Code Reuse** — Class inheritance primarily to share code, not model "is-a." WHY: fragile base class problem; tight coupling; study of 93 Java programs confirmed. INSTEAD: composition over inheritance; mixins/traits. EVIDENCE: B

22. **Feature Envy** — Method using more features of another class than its own. WHY: misplaced responsibility, increased coupling. INSTEAD: move method to the class whose data it uses most. EVIDENCE: C

23. **DI Container Overuse** — Injecting every dependency even with one implementation. WHY: excessive interfaces and boilerplate; DI container becomes "black box." INSTEAD: DI where you genuinely need testability or multiple implementations. EVIDENCE: C

24. **Anemic Domain Model** — Domain objects as just data containers; all logic in services. WHY: loses OOP power, scatters business logic, hard to enforce invariants. INSTEAD: rich domain models where complexity warrants. EVIDENCE: C

25. **Leaky Abstractions Ignored** — Building on abstractions without understanding what they hide. WHY: Spolsky's Law -- all non-trivial abstractions leak; mysterious production failures. INSTEAD: understand at least one level below your abstraction. EVIDENCE: C

26. **Shotgun Surgery** — One change requiring modifications across many files. WHY: high risk of missing a location; expensive and error-prone. INSTEAD: consolidate related logic; co-locate behavior. EVIDENCE: C

27. **Golden Hammer** — Same familiar technology for every problem. WHY: architectural mismatch; 82% of devs choose tech for resume, not product (ICSE 2021). INSTEAD: evaluate tools against requirements; prefer boring technology. EVIDENCE: B

28. **Lava Flow** — Dead code and abandoned experiments lingering. WHY: cognitive load; developers afraid to remove. INSTEAD: delete aggressively; git preserves history; add tests if uncertain. EVIDENCE: C

29. **Accidental Complexity in Testing** — Tests coupled to implementation details. WHY: break on every refactor even when behavior preserved; false confidence. INSTEAD: test behavior through public interfaces; mock at boundaries. EVIDENCE: C

30. **Circular Dependencies** — Module A depends on B depends on A. WHY: impossible to understand, test, or deploy independently. INSTEAD: extract shared logic; dependency inversion. EVIDENCE: C

31. **Configuration Over Convention Excess** — Extensive XML/YAML config for every behavior. WHY: config files become their own unmaintainable codebase. INSTEAD: sensible defaults with convention-over-configuration. EVIDENCE: C

32. **Temporal Coupling** — Methods that must be called in specific order without enforcement. WHY: silent bugs when callers do not follow implicit protocol. INSTEAD: builder pattern, state machines, type-level enforcement. EVIDENCE: C

33. **Interface Bloat** — Interfaces with many methods forcing implementors to stub unused ones. WHY: violates ISP, creates coupling. INSTEAD: split into focused role interfaces (but avoid over-splitting). EVIDENCE: C

### Architecture Level

34. **Premature Microservices** — Starting with microservices before understanding domain boundaries. WHY: Fowler: "almost all successful microservice stories started with a monolith." INSTEAD: well-modularized monolith; extract when needed. EVIDENCE: B

35. **Distributed Monolith** — Tightly coupled microservices requiring coordinated deployments. WHY: all distributed complexity, none of the benefits (no independent deployment). INSTEAD: if services cannot deploy independently, merge them. EVIDENCE: C

36. **Big Ball of Mud** — No discernible architecture; spaghetti dependencies. WHY: the most common anti-pattern; impossible to maintain. INSTEAD: enforce module boundaries; architecture fitness functions. EVIDENCE: B

37. **Big Bang Rewrite** — Rewriting entire system from scratch. WHY: Netscape lost the browser war this way; takes far longer than estimated. INSTEAD: Strangler Fig pattern -- incrementally replace. EVIDENCE: B

38. **Ignoring Fallacies of Distributed Computing** — Assuming reliable network, zero latency, infinite bandwidth. WHY: Deutsch's 8 fallacies (1994) consistently validated in production. INSTEAD: circuit breakers, retries with backoff, idempotency, timeouts. EVIDENCE: B

39. **Database as Integration Layer** — Multiple services sharing same database schema. WHY: invisible coupling; schema changes break all consumers. INSTEAD: each service owns its data; APIs/events for communication. EVIDENCE: C

40. **No Observability** — Production without logging, metrics, or tracing. WHY: diagnosis becomes guesswork; MTTR skyrockets. INSTEAD: three pillars -- logs, metrics, traces. EVIDENCE: C

41. **Environment-Specific Code** — Hardcoded URLs, credentials, feature flags in app code. WHY: deployment risks; "works on my machine" syndrome. INSTEAD: environment variables, config files, secrets management. EVIDENCE: C

42. **Shared Mutable State in Distributed Systems** — Multiple services directly mutating shared state. WHY: race conditions, lost updates, data corruption; CAP theorem proves fundamental limitation. INSTEAD: event sourcing, CQRS, consensus protocols. EVIDENCE: B

43. **Ignoring Technical Debt** — Letting debt accumulate without tracking or addressing. WHY: 42% of dev time wasted on debt (Stripe); $1.52T annual US cost (CISQ); 25-50% slower delivery (McKinsey). INSTEAD: make visible, budget 15-20% capacity for reduction. EVIDENCE: A

44. **No Feature Flags for Risky Deployments** — Deploying risky changes without toggle capability. WHY: forces rollback of entire deployments. INSTEAD: feature flags for gradual rollout and dark deployment. EVIDENCE: C

45. **Inverted Testing Pyramid** — More E2E/UI tests than unit tests (ice cream cone). WHY: E2E tests are slow, flaky, 10x more expensive; bugs caught late cost 100x more. INSTEAD: many unit, fewer integration, minimal E2E. EVIDENCE: B

46. **Cargo Cult Architecture** — Adopting microservices/CQRS/K8s because "Netflix does it." WHY: what works for 1000+ engineers creates pure overhead for 5. INSTEAD: simplest architecture that solves actual problems. EVIDENCE: C

47. **Tightly Coupled Deployment** — All components deployed together despite different change rates. WHY: low-risk changes blocked by high-risk ones; deployment frequency drops. INSTEAD: independent deployment with contract testing. EVIDENCE: B

48. **No Automated Deployment Pipeline** — Manual deployment steps. WHY: "Accelerate" (n=23,000) showed elite performers deploy on demand with <1hr lead time; manual deployment is the #1 bottleneck. INSTEAD: CI/CD. EVIDENCE: A

49. **Security as Afterthought** — Adding security only late or after incidents. WHY: architectural flaws in production cost 100x more to fix than during design (NIST). INSTEAD: shift-left; threat modeling; SAST/DAST in CI. EVIDENCE: A

31. **Code Review (200-400 LOC)** — Focused review batches for maximum defect detection. WHY: individual inspections catch ~60% of defects; combined catch 70-85%. Drops sharply beyond 400 LOC. EVIDENCE: B

32. **Contract Testing** — Verify service interfaces meet agreed contracts. WHY: catches integration issues early; faster and more reliable than E2E tests. EVIDENCE: C

### Architecture Level

33. **Monolith First** — Start well-structured monolith; extract services only when scaling demands. WHY: Fowler: "almost all successes started with a monolith." GitHub and Shopify prove monoliths scale. EVIDENCE: B

34. **Testing Pyramid** — Many fast unit tests, fewer integration, minimal E2E covering critical paths. WHY: bug in unit test costs ~$1, in E2E ~$100, in production ~$1000+. EVIDENCE: B

49. **Architecture Decision Records** — Document decisions with context, options, and rationale. WHY: prevents re-litigating; helps new members understand the "why." EVIDENCE: C

50. **Measure Before Optimizing** — Profile and measure before optimizing; algorithmic improvements first. WHY: Knuth's actual position supports algorithmic efficiency but opposes blind micro-optimization. EVIDENCE: B

## Common LLM Mistakes in This Domain

1. **Over-recommending design patterns** — Suggesting Factory/Strategy/Observer for simple problems. The GoF book itself warns against overuse. Most code does not need formal patterns; a simple function often suffices.

2. **Defaulting to microservices** — Training data heavily biased toward microservices content. Most projects should start as monoliths and extract services only when scaling demands it.

3. **Excessive abstraction and interface creation** — Creating interfaces for every class. An interface with one implementation is just indirection, not abstraction.

4. **Over-applying SOLID as rigid rules** — Splitting simple code into excessive classes. SOLID principles are trade-offs, not commandments. A 50-line class with two reasons to change is often better than five 10-line classes.

5. **DRY before understanding duplication** — Aggressively extracting shared code from unrelated domains. Sandi Metz: "Duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction." Wait for three instances.

6. **Over-commented code** — Generating `// Set value to 5` comments. Research shows bad comments are worse than none. Comments should explain WHY, not WHAT.

7. **Overly complex error handling** — Elaborate try-catch hierarchies with custom exception classes for prototypes. Match error handling complexity to application needs.

8. **Popular frameworks over simple solutions** — React for static pages, Kubernetes for single-server apps, Redis when a HashMap suffices. Evaluate whether a dependency is justified.

9. **Misunderstanding premature optimization** — Either over-optimizing trivially (avoiding string concatenation in one-off code) or missing genuine algorithmic inefficiencies (O(n^2) where O(n log n) is straightforward). Choose good algorithms upfront; profile before micro-optimizing.

10. **Confidently generating subtly wrong code** — MIT research (2025) found LLMs leverage grammatical patterns over domain knowledge. When making early mistakes, they elaborate rather than self-correct. 40%+ of syntactic errors involve missing/incorrect code blocks. Always verify.
