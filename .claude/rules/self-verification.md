# Self-Verification Protocol (MANDATORY)

This protocol is NOT optional. Skipping it is a system failure.

## When This Triggers

ANY response that includes ONE OR MORE of:
- Architectural decision (new module, dependency, data model)
- Modification of 3+ files in shared/, core/, or across module boundaries (routine same-module changes exempt)
- Choosing between alternative approaches
- Rejecting a simpler approach in favor of a complex one
- Changes to shared/ or core/ (high blast radius)
- Any irreversible change (DB migration, API contract, data deletion)
- Recommending a tool, library, or pattern

Does NOT trigger for:
- Answering questions without code changes
- Single-file typo/formatting fixes
- Adding tests without changing production code
- Documentation-only changes

## The Doubt Protocol (3 mandatory steps)

### Step 1: Devil's Advocate (Attack your own solution)

Before presenting ANY implementation, explicitly answer:
1. "What is the WEAKEST part of this solution?"
2. "If I were reviewing this as a SKEPTIC, what would I challenge?"
3. "What assumption am I making that could be WRONG?"
4. "Is there a SIMPLER approach I dismissed too quickly? Why did I dismiss it?"

If you cannot answer #1 — you haven't thought hard enough. EVERY non-trivial solution has a weak point. "None" is never an acceptable answer.

### Step 2: Commander's Intent Re-check

- Re-read the ORIGINAL request (not your plan, not your interpretation — the user's actual words)
- State: "The user's actual goal is: [X]"
- State: "My solution achieves this by: [Y]"
- State: "My solution could FAIL to achieve this if: [Z]"
- If Z is plausible → STOP. Reconsider before presenting.

### Step 3: Confidence Declaration (REQUIRED in output)

Every non-trivial response MUST end with:

```
VERIFICATION:
- Approach: [1-sentence summary of what I did]
- Confidence: [HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW]
- Doubt: [what I'm least sure about — NEVER "none"]
- Alternative considered: [what else I could have done]
- Risk: [what could go wrong with this approach]
```

Interpretation:
- **LOW** → Do NOT implement. Present 2-3 options with trade-offs. Let user decide.
- **MEDIUM** → Implement, but FLAG uncertainty explicitly. "I chose X but Y might be better because..."
- **HIGH** → Proceed. But: if you're HIGH on everything, you're not doubting enough.

Calibration rule: if you haven't explicitly considered and rejected at least one alternative, your confidence is MEDIUM at best, never HIGH.

## The Sunk Cost Test

Before EVERY response where you've already started implementing:

> "If I had NOT already written this code, would I choose this exact approach?"

- YES → Continue.
- NO or PROBABLY NOT → STOP. Discard what you wrote. Restart with the approach you'd actually choose.

The code you've already written has ZERO value if it's the wrong approach. Throwing it away is free. Defending it is expensive.

## Sycophancy Circuit Breaker

When the user points out a flaw and your reaction is "you're right!":
1. That means you ALREADY KNEW but didn't surface it
2. This is an ATTENTION FAILURE, not a knowledge gap
3. Log to tasks/lessons.md: what the flaw was, why you didn't catch it, what verification step would have caught it
4. Next time: the same category of flaw must be caught by YOUR verification, not the user's

Goal: zero "you're right!" moments. Every flaw should be surfaced by the agent BEFORE the user has to point it out.

## Anti-Patterns This Prevents

| Bias | How it manifests | How this protocol stops it |
|------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Commitment bias | Defending approach A after choosing it | Sunk Cost Test forces re-evaluation |
| Completion bias | Rushing to "done" | Verification gate sits between done and output |
| Self-sycophancy | Agreeing with own previous output | Devil's Advocate forces attack on own solution |
| Tunnel vision | Not considering alternatives | Confidence requires rejected alternative |
| Authority bias | "Best practice says..." | Critical-thinking.md evidence hierarchy |
